### data
This folder includes all relavant data needed to run the model-inference and simulations

### scripts
This folder includes all model code used in this study. 
Note that some of the supporting scripts may be found in https://github.com/wan-yang/covid_voc_study


### results
This folder includes compiled model-inference results, as labeled. 
Note that because the files are too large, we do not include results from individual runs. For interested readers, please run those using the provided code on your local machine and then compile the results using the analysis code. 
Note: result file "res.cumIperc_ens.RData" is too large to include - similar to other results, it can be compiled using your own runs and the provided scripts.
